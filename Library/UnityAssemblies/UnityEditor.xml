The Popup has three toggle values, and will automatically close when it loses focus. The example is given as two scripts. The first defines an editor window that can be opened via a menu item. That editor window has a button which shows the popup. The second script defines the contents of the popup itself as a separate class.

        <para>Base class to derive custom property drawers from. Use this to create custom drawers for your own <c>Serializable</c> classes or for script variables with custom <see cref="UnityEngine.PropertyAttribute"></see>s.</para>
        <para>PropertyDrawers have two uses: - Customize the GUI of every instance of a <c>Serializable</c> class. - Customize the GUI of script members with custom <see cref="UnityEngine.PropertyAttribute"></see>s. If you have a custom <c>Serializable</c> class, you can use a PropertyDrawer to control how it looks in the Inspector. Consider the Serializable class Ingredient in the script below:</para>
        <para>Using a custom PropertyDrawer, every appearance of the Ingredient class in the Inspector can be changed. Compare the look of the Ingredient properties in the Inspector without and with a custom PropertyDrawer: <c>Class in the Inspector without (left) and with (right) custom PropertyDrawer.</c> You can attach the PropertyDrawer to a Serializable class by using the <see cref="UnityEditor.CustomPropertyDrawer"></see> attribute and pass in the type of the Serializable class that it's a drawer for.</para>
        <para>The other use of PropertyDrawer is to alter the appearance of members in a script that have custom <see cref="UnityEngine.PropertyAttribute"></see>s. Say you want to limit floats or integers in your script to a certain range and show them as sliders in the Inspector. Using the built-in <see cref="UnityEngine.PropertyAttribute"></see> called <see cref="UnityEngine.RangeAttribute"></see> you can do just that:</para>
        <para>You can make your own <see cref="UnityEngine.PropertyAttribute"></see> as well. We'll use the code for the <see cref="UnityEngine.RangeAttribute"></see> as an example. The attribute must extend the PropertyAttribute class. If you want, your property can take parameters and store them as public member variables.</para>
        <para>Now that you have the attribute, you need to make a PropertyDrawer that draws properties that have that attribute. The drawer must extend the PropertyDrawer class, and it must have a <see cref="UnityEditor.CustomPropertyDrawer"></see> attribute to tell it which attribute it's a drawer for.</para>

    <member name="T:UnityEditor.MenuItem">
      <summary>
        <para>The MenuItem attribute allows you to add menu items to the main menu and inspector context menus.</para>
        <para>The MenuItem attribute turns any static function into a menu command. Only static functions can use the MenuItem attribute. To create a hotkey you can use the following special characters: % (ctrl on Windows, cmd on macOS), # (shift), &amp; (alt). If no special modifier key combinations are required the key can be given after an underscore. For example to create a menu with hotkey shift-alt-g use <c>"MyMenu/Do Something #&amp;g"</c>. To create a menu with hotkey g and no key modifiers pressed use <c>"MyMenu/Do Something _g"</c>. Some special keyboard keys are supported as hotkeys, for example "#LEFT" would map to shift-left. The keys supported like this are: LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, F1 .. F12, HOME, END, PGUP, PGDN. A hotkey text must be preceded with a space character (<c>"MyMenu/Do_g"</c> won't be interpreted as hotkey, while <c>"MyMenu/Do _g"</c> will). When adding menu items to the "GameObject/" menu for creating custom game objects be sure to call <see cref="UnityEditor.GameObjectUtility.SetParentAndAlign"></see> to ensure that the new GameObject is reparented correctly in the case of a context click (see example below). Your function should also call <see cref="UnityEditor.Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo"></see> to make the creation undoable and set <see cref="UnityEditor.Selection.activeObject"></see> to the newly created object. Also note that in order for a menu item in "GameObject/" to be propagated to the hierarchy Create dropdown and hierarchy context menu, it must be grouped with the other GameObject creation menu items. This can be achieved by setting its priority to 10 (see example below). Note that for legacy purposes MenuItems in "GameObject/Create Other" with no explicit priority set will receive a priority of 10 instead of the default 1000 - we encourage using a more descriptive category name than "Create Other" and explicitly setting the priority to 10.</para>

        <para>Default built-in brush for painting or erasing tiles and/or gamobjects on a grid.</para>
        <para>Default brush is meant for two things: Authoring GameObjects on a grid and authoring tiles on a grid. It can be used for both at the same time if necessary. Basically the default brush allows you to pick and paste tiles and GameObjects from one area to another. Tiles in a tilemap are considered to be active for brush editing if a GameObject with <see cref="UnityEngine.Tilemaps.Tilemap"></see> is currently selected. GameObjects are considered to be active for brush editing if their parent GameObject is currently selected. For example: A new default brush with size of 2x3 is generated as a result of scene view picking operation. The new instance contains six cells (<see cref="UnityEditor.GridBrush.BrushCell"></see>) and the cells are fed with tiles &amp; GameObjects from the picking area. Later when this brush is used in a painting operation, all the tiles and GameObjects contained in the cells are set/cloned into a new scene position. When creating custom brushes, it is recommended to inherit <see cref="UnityEngine.GridBrushBase"></see> by default. Inheriting GridBrush is possible when similar functionality is required, but extending it has its limits compared to base class. It is also possible to replace the default GridBrush from the Tile Palette brush list completely by using the GridDefaultBrush attribute on one of your custom brushes and promote it to become a new default brush of the project. This is useful when higher level brush can operate as a default and protect designers from accidentally using the built-in one.</para>

        <para>Handles are the 3D controls that Unity uses to manipulate items in the scene view. There are a number of built-in Handle GUIs, such as the familiar tools to position, scale and rotate an object via the Transform component. However, it is also possible to define your own Handle GUIs to use with custom component editors. Such GUIs can be a very useful way to edit procedurally-generated scene content, "invisible" items and groups of related objects, such as waypoints and location markers. You can also supplement the 3D Handle GUI in the scene with 2D buttons and other controls overlaid on the scene view. This is done by enclosing standard Unity GUI calls in a Handles.BeginGUI / EndGUI pair within the //OnSceneGUI// function. You can use HandleUtility.GUIPointToWorldRay and HandleUtility.WorldToGUIPoint to convert coordinates between 2D GUI and 3D world coordinates.</para>

      <summary>
        <para>Base class to derive custom material property drawers from.</para>
        <para>Use this to create custom UI drawers for your material properties, without having to write custom <see cref="UnityEditor.MaterialEditor"></see> classes. This is similar to how <see cref="UnityEditor.PropertyDrawer"></see> enables custom UI without writing custom inspectors. In shader code, C#-like attribute syntax can be used in front of shader properties to add drawers to them. Unity has several built-in drawers, and you can write your own. Here's a shader code snippet demonstrating the syntax:</para>
        <para>When implementing your own drawers, you should override OnGUI function. You can also optionally override GetPropertyHeight and Apply functions. Here's an example of a property drawer that displays a checkbox for a float property, with the value set to 0 or 1 depending on the state:</para>
        <para>The built-in MaterialPropertyDrawers are: ToggleDrawer, EnumDrawer, KeywordEnumDrawer, PowerSliderDrawer, IntRangeDrawer. In shader code, the "Drawer" suffix of the class name is not written; when Unity searches for the drawer class it adds "Drawer" automatically. Toggle displays a float as a toggle. The property value will be 0 or 1, depending on the toggle state. When it is on, a shader keyword with the uppercase property name +"_ON" will be set, or an explicitly specified shader keyword.</para>
        <para>Enum displays a popup menu for a float property. You can supply either an enum type name (preferably fully qualified with namespaces, in case there are multiple types), or explicit name/value pairs to display. Up to 7 name/value pairs can be specified.</para>
        <para>KeywordEnum displays a popup menu for a float property, and enables corresponding shader keyword. This is used with "#pragma multi_compile" in shaders, to enable or disable parts of shader code. Each name will enable "property name" + underscore + "enum name", uppercased, shader keyword. Up to 9 names can be provided.</para>
        <para>PowerSlider displays a slider with a non-linear response for a Range shader property.</para>
        <para>IntRange displays an integer slider for a Range shader property.</para>
        <para>When a property drawer class name ends with "Decorator", that is a property decorator, similar to <see cref="UnityEditor.DecoratorDrawer"></see>. They are used to create headings and dividers between properties that don't affect the property itself. A single property can have multiple decorators on it. The built-in decorator drawers are: SpaceDecorator, HeaderDecorator. Space creates vertical space before the shader property.</para>
        <para>Header creates a header text before the shader property.</para>
        <para>Note that for performance reasons, EditorGUILayout functions are not usable with MaterialPropertyDrawers.</para>

      <summary>
        <para>Used to specify how to find a given element in the editor to highlight.</para>
        <para>Let's consider various approaches to highlighting the Scale control in the Transform component. Using the <see cref="UnityEditor.HighlightSearchMode.PrefixLabel"></see> mode you can specify the label text "Scale" as the identifier to highlight the entire Scale control with both label and all three number fields included. This mode can't be used if you want to only highlight the X component of the Scale control. Since the label text of the X component is simply "X", you would get the X component of the Position control instead if you attempted that. The <see cref="UnityEditor.HighlightSearchMode.PrefixLabel"></see> mode works for any control that uses <see cref="UnityEditor.EditorGUI.PrefixLabel"></see> or <see cref="UnityEditor.EditorGUI.HandlePrefixLabel"></see>. If you use the <see cref="UnityEditor.HighlightSearchMode.Content"></see> mode to seach for the text "Scale", only the label itself will be highlighted. This mode can highlight what corresponds to a single <see cref="UnityEngine.GUIStyle.Draw"></see> call and hence cannot highlight composite controls. It is particularly useful for highlighting buttons. The <see cref="UnityEditor.HighlightSearchMode.Identifier"></see> mode searches for rects explicitly marked to be highlightable using the <see cref="UnityEditor.Highlighter.HighlightIdentifier"></see> function. This is for example done for all controls that uses the <see cref="UnityEditor.SerializedProperty"></see> system, using the <see cref="UnityEditor.SerializedProperty.propertyPath"></see> as the identifier. This means you could use this mode to highlight the X component of the Scale control by searching for "m_LocalScale.x". The <see cref="UnityEditor.HighlightSearchMode.Auto"></see> mode searches using all the above modes and can be used in most cases. Searching for "Scale" using this mode will highlight the entire Scale control rather than just the label, since the PrefixLabel handling is hit before the <see cref="UnityEngine.GUIStyle.Draw"></see> call of the label.</para>

The demo can be launched from the "Examples/AnimationMode demo" menu. Once this demo starts it requires a GameObject to be selected in the Scene window. (This example requires the game to not be running in the Game view.) After a GameObject has been selected the example window will change. Choose a created animation clip for the chosen GameObject. Once the animation clip has been loaded the animation can be applied to the GameObject. Clicking the Animate button adds a slider to the window. Using the slider will apply the animation to the selected GameObject. The Lock button prevents the animation to be applied to a different GameObject.</para>

If deferring is enabled on a specific screen edge, the first swipe is ignored and provides a way to reduce unwanted interactions with the App. Note that iOS Human interface guidelines do not recommend enabling this behavior as it may confuse users.</para>

        <para>During model import the functions are called in the the following order: - <see cref="UnityEditor.AssetPostprocessor.OnPreprocessModel"></see> is called at the very beginning and you can override <see cref="UnityEditor.ModelImporter"></see> settings that are used for the whole model import process. - Once Meshes and Materials are imported, we create GameObjects hierarchy from the imported nodes. Every GameObject that represents imported node gets correspondent MeshFilter, MeshRenderer and MeshCollider components. Before assigning a Material to the MeshRenderer <see cref="UnityEditor.AssetPostprocessor.OnAssignMaterialModel"></see> function is invoked. - After GameObject has initialized MeshRenderers and "userdata" exists <see cref="UnityEditor.AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessGameObjectWithUserProperties"></see> is called. That happens before children GameObjects are generated. - If animation generation was not disabled at previous stages (see <see cref="UnityEditor.ModelImporter.generateAnimations"></see>), then SkinnedMesh and Animations are generated. If possible Avatar is also created and GameObjecs hierarchy is optimized. After that <see cref="UnityEditor.AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessModel"></see> is called for the root GameObject. <see cref="UnityEditor.AssetPostprocessor.OnPreprocessSpeedTree"></see> and <see cref="UnityEditor.AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessSpeedTree"></see> are called on SpeedTree assets (.spm file) the same way as <see cref="UnityEditor.AssetPostprocessor.OnPreprocessModel"></see> and <see cref="UnityEditor.AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessModel"></see>, except that the <see cref="UnityEditor.AssetPostprocessor.assetImporter"></see> type is <see cref="UnityEditor.SpeedTreeImporter"></see>. In a production pipeline AssetPostprocessors should always be placed in pre-built dll's in the project instead of in scripts. AssetPostprocessors change the output of imported assets, thus a compile error in one of the scripts will lead to assets being imported differently. This can be a severe issue when working in a production pipeline. By using dll's for AssetPostprocessors you ensure that they can always be executed even if the scripts have compile errors. This way you can override default values in the import settings or modify the imported data like textures or meshes.</para>

      <summary>
        <para>Base class to derive custom decorator drawers from.</para>
        <para>A DecoratorDrawer is similar to a <see cref="UnityEditor.PropertyDrawer"></see>, except that it doesn't draw a property but rather draws decorative elements based purely on the data it gets from its corresponding <see cref="UnityEngine.PropertyAttribute"></see>. Unity uses builtin DecoratorDrawers for the <see cref="UnityEngine.SpaceAttribute"></see> and <see cref="UnityEngine.HeaderAttribute"></see>. You can also create your own DecoratorDrawers with matching PropertyAttributes. Although a DecoratorDrawer conceptually is not meant to be associated with a specific field, its attribute still needs to be placed above a field in the script. However, unlike PropertyDrawer attributes, there can be multiple DecoratorDrawers attributes above the same field. Also unlike PropertyDrawers, if a DecoratorDrawer attribute is placed above a field that is a List or an array, the decorator will only show up once before the array; not for every array element. The example below comes in two scripts. The first script defines the an example attribute called "ColorSpacer", and then defines a DecoratorDrawer which determines how it should be drawn in the inspector. The second script is an example MonoBehaviour which uses the ColorSpacer attribute to visually separate two groups of public properties in the inspector.</para>
        <para>And this second script is the one which makes use of the ColorSpacer attribute defined above:</para>

        <para>Using a custom Editor, the apperance of the script in the Inspector can be changed, for example to look like this: <c>Custom editor in the Inspector.</c> You can attach the Editor to a custom component by using the <see cref="UnityEditor.CustomEditor"></see> attribute. There are multiple ways to design custom Editors. If you want the Editor to support multi-object editing, you can use the <see cref="UnityEditor.CanEditMultipleObjects"></see> attribute. Instead of modifying script variables directly, it's advantageous to use the <see cref="UnityEditor.SerializedObject"></see> and <see cref="UnityEditor.SerializedProperty"></see> system to edit them, since this automatically handles multi-object editing, undo, and prefab overrides. If this approach is used a user can select multiple assets in the hierarchy window and change the values for all of them at once.</para>
        <para>Alternatively, if automatic handling of multi-object editing, undo, and prefab overrides is not needed, the script variables can be modified directly by the editor without using the <see cref="UnityEditor.SerializedObject"></see> and <see cref="UnityEditor.SerializedProperty"></see> system, as in the example below.</para>

        <para>If <see cref="UnityEditor.Animations.AnimatorStateTransition.hasExitTime"></see> is true, exitTime represents the exact time at which the transition can take effect. This is represented in normalized time, so for example an exit time of 0.75 means that on the first frame where 75% of the animation has played, the Exit Time condition will be true. On the next frame, the condition will be false. For looped animations, transitions with exit times smaller than 1 will be evaluated every loop, so you can use this to time your transition with the proper timing in the animation, every loop. Transitions with exit times greater than one will be evaluated only once, so they can be used to exit at a specific time, after a fixed number of loops. For example, a transition with an exit time of 3.5 will be evaluated once, after three and a half loops.</para>
        <para>Known limitation: You need at least one evaluation of your state before you can trigger an exitTime condition, meaning a transition with an exitTime of 0 will never be fired on the first frame.</para>

Use this when submitting games to Apple for publishing on the App Store. This prevents people from running the game on any computer then the one it was purchased on. Note that this feature does not implement any strong copy protection. In particular, any potential crack against one Unity game would work against any other Unity content. For this reason, it is recommended that you implement your own receipt validation code on top of this using Unity's plugin feature. However, since Apple requires plugin validation to initially happen before showing the screen setup dialog, you should still enable this check, or Apple might reject your submission.</para>

        <para>This value controls the maximum size of arrays that can be edited during multiple-object-editing in the inspector. When you have GameObjects selected that share arrays larger than this value, the inspector will show an empty array. Prior to Unity 5.5, this value was hard-coded and could not be changed. A default value of 64 has been chosen as a good tradeoff between performance and utility. If your serialized object typically has arrays larger than this, you can set this value to a higher number to allow multi-editing on those arrays. Please be aware that setting too high a value might affect inspector performance when editing large arrays or a large number of objects</para>

The fields available are the same as are accessible via the <see cref="UnityEditor.SerializedObject"></see> API, or as found in the YAML-serialized form of the object. Note that using this method with a struct may not do what you expect because structs are passed to the method by value and not by reference. This means that instead of the method overwriting your original struct, a boxed copy of the struct is passed into the method and overwritten. You can avoid this by making your own boxed copy of the struct to pass into the method and then copying the values back again after the method returns. See example below. Even when you do this, Unity’s built-in structs (such as <see cref="UnityEngine.Vector3"></see> or <see cref="UnityEngine.Bounds"></see>) cannot be directly passed to the method, so you must enclose Unity’s built-in structs inside a wrapper class or struct.</para>

        <para>Marks <c>target</c> object as dirty. (Only suitable for non-scene objects).</para>
        <para>NOTE: ''Prior to Unity 5.3, this was the primary method of marking objects as dirty. From 5.3 onwards, with the introduction of Multi-Scene Editing, this function should no-longer be used for modifying objects in scenes. Instead, you should use <see cref="UnityEditor.Undo.RecordObject"></see> prior to making changes to the object. This will mark the object's scene as dirty and provide an undo entry in the editor.'' If you are modifying files within a scene and specifically do not want to add an undo entry for your modification, you should use <see cref="UnityEditor.SceneManagement.EditorSceneManager.MarkSceneDirty"></see> If you are using a custom editor to modify serialized properties on a component or an asset, you should be using [pSerializedObject.FindProperty]], <see cref="UnityEditor.SerializedObject.Update"></see>, <see cref="UnityEditor.EditorGUILayout.PropertyField"></see>, and <see cref="UnityEditor.SerializedObject.ApplyModifiedProperties"></see>. This will mark the modified object as 'dirty' and create Undo states for you. Therefore the only remaining situation in which you should use this function is if you are modifying non-scene objects via some other means, <c>and</c> specifically do not want create an undo entry for your modification. This is rare, and unless you're very sure about requiring this, you probably shouldn't be using this command! Unity internally uses the dirty flag to find out when assets have changed and need to be saved to disk.</para>

Most "regular textures" store color data in sRGB color space, and for them this flag should be set to true. Non-color textures are typically stored as linear values, and the GPU should not do any color space conversions. This flag is set to false in this case. Unity marks various non-color textures (e.g. normal maps) as "linear" by default. Legacy IMGUI textures should be set as linear too.

Most "regular textures" store color data in sRGB color space, and for them this flag should be set to true. Non-color textures are typically stored as linear values, and the GPU should not do any color space conversions. This flag is set to false in this case. Unity marks various non-color textures (e.g. normal maps) as "linear" by default. Legacy IMGUI textures should be set as linear too. This flag corresponds to "sRGB (Color Texture)" option in class-TextureImporter.</para>

        <para>Bakes an array of scenes.</para>
        <para>This loads all scenes and then builds all lightmaps, reflection probes and enlighten data. The function automatically splits all baked data based on scene. Lightmap atlasses for example are always split between scenes. Thus you can bake lightmaps for two adjacent levels and light and shadows casted onto objects in level A will be affected by the objects in level B. Enlighten system data will automatically connect neighboring systems when it is additively loaded, thus bounce lighting can flow from one scene to another. A single LightProbe asset is generated for all scenes. Hence for the time being, lightprobes always take as much memory as there are lightprobes in all levels that are baked together. Only one ambient probe &amp; default sky probe will be baked and assigned to each scene. Multiple Lightmapsnapshot objects containing the data for each scene are written into a single file in "MyScene/LightmapSnapshot.asset". At build time this data will also be automatically split as well, hence if you bake multiple scenes but then only deploy one scene then only the lightmap data for that scene will be deployed.</para>

        <para>This allows you to rebuild an asset bundle and reference assets in it directly. When rebuilding the asset bundle the objects in it are guaranteed to have the same id after rebuilding the asset bundle. Due to it being a 32 bit hash space, if you have a lot of objects in the asset bundle it will increase the potential for hash conflicts. Unity will give an error and not build the asset bundle in that case. The hash is based on the GUID of the asset and the local id of the object in the asset. DeterministicAssetBundle are also slower to load from than normal asset bundles, this is because the threaded background loading API usually expects objects to be ordered in a way that makes reading reduce seeking. With DeterministicAssetBundles that is not possible. Note: This feature is always enabled.</para>

        <para>The precompute calculates visibility from ray origins to clusters, but attempts to reject ray origins that are inside geometry. If the percentage of rays that hit front faces is less than backFaceTolerance, the ray origin is marked invalid and will not affect the radiosity computation. For example, if backFaceTolerance is 0.0, the ray origin is rejected only if it sees nothing but backfaces. If 1.0, the ray origin is rejected if it has even one ray that hits a backface. This setting can help control light leaking, but should be considered in the context of the mesh authoring workflow. Preventing the rejection of ray origins by setting a value of 0.0 will ensure Enlighten does not reject ray origins due to single-sided geometry. However, if the majority of the meshes are closed, so visible backfaces are rare, a positive value can reduce light leaking or darkening that intersecting geometry would otherwise cause.</para>

        <para>Typically this resolution can be slightly lower than the resolution of the realtime lightmap without significantly reducing the final quality, although this depends on the kinds of lighting environments you wish to use. Small, bright light sources will require a higher clusterResolution for Enlighten to capture them accurately. Cluster resolution is multiplied by the realtime lightmap resolution. A high value means a higher cluster resolution. A value of 1 matches each texel in the realtime lightmap with one input cluster. Using a very small cluster resolution results in light being smeared across the output texels. Larger values do not significantly increase quality (as they have to be averaged for the final output texel), but can cause unnecessary increases in time and memory footprint.</para>

        <para>Can be used to alleviate issues when objects are close together and the gap between the objects should not be used in the calculation of GI. In some cases having an object near a surface may cause a dark halo on the surface around the perimeter of the object because there is a small gap between the object and the surface where nearly no light will enter causing a very dark pixel. These dark pixels can look bad if they are partially visible and not completely obscured by the object. Increasing the modelling tolerance will make the GI calculation ignore the parts of the pixel that are very near another surface. The value is multiplier on the pixel size. If you want to ignore 5cm gaps with a realtime resolution of 2 texels per meter you would need a modelling tolerance of 0.01.</para>

        <para>A polyline is simply a zigzag line defined by a set of points connected in sequence. The ClosestPointToPolyLine function takes the polyline defined by a point array and "flattens" it into screen space. The closest point between the flattened line and the current mouse position (also in screen space) is then found and converted back into a 3D point on the original 3D polyline. This is useful for Handle GUIs that involve manipulating an arbitrary 3D shape using the mouse; the 2D mouse movements are converted into 3D space in the familiar way used by Unity's built-in tools. An example of where this might be used is a racetrack defined by a set of waypoints - a position along the track line could be selected via the mouse using ClosestPointToPolyLine.</para>

        <para>This value allows the data to be stored in a compressed form when the Player is deployed to a device. Decompression is performed in real time when the Player reads the data. Scene or Asset loading might be faster or slower depending on disk read speed when compared to using uncompressed data. Compressed data files include: 1. Player settings - <c>globalgamemanagers</c> and <c>globalgamemanagers.assets</c> files. 2. Scenes and Assets - <c>level*</c> and <c>sharedassets*.asset</c> files. 3. Resources - <c>resources.assets</c> files. 4. GI data. 5. Built-in resources - <c>unity_builtin_extra</c> file. <c>CompressWithLz4</c> sets compression parameters to LZ4 compression and splits data files into 128KB chunks. This feature is supported for Standalone, Android, iOS, Tizen build targets and is default for WebGL target. Enabling <c>CompressWithLz4</c> in Android might be a significant performance boost when loading data as LZ4 decompression is faster than the default Zip decompression. Note: Compression might affect the size of a game installer making it larger, even though size of the Player on a device is smaller. Subsequent compression is less efficient or even impossible.</para>

        <para>This function works similarly to <see cref="UnityEditor.Undo.RegisterCompleteObjectUndo"></see>. The key difference is that instead of copying the states of a single object, this function stores the states of a hierarchy of objects. Depending on the type of <c>objectToUndo</c>, the hierarchy is determined differently: * If <c>objectToUndo</c> is a game object, the hierarchy will contain (a) <c>objectToUndo</c> itself and its child game objects; (b) the components attached to these game objects. * If <c>objectToUndo</c> is a component attached to an existing game object, the hierarchy will contain the game object and all of its components, including <c>objectToUndo</c>. Child game objects are NOT involved in this case. * In all other cases, the hierarchy will only contain <c>objectToUndo</c> itself. It's then equivalent to calling <see cref="UnityEditor.Undo.RegisterCompleteObjectUndo"></see> with the same parameters. If the undo is performed, any changes made to the objects in the above described hierarchy after this function is called will be undone, and the objects will be restored to the recorded state. Transform parent change, AddComponent, and object destruction can not be restored with this function, for that you should use the dedicated functions.

Further, the name used in the filter <c>string</c> can be specified as a subsection. For example the <c>test asset</c> example above can be matched using <c>test</c>. Labels: Assets can have labels attached to them. Assets with particular labels can be found use the keyword 'l:' before each label. This indicates that the string is searching for labels. Types: Find assets based on explicitly identified types. The keyword 't:' is used as a way to specify that typed assets are being looked for. If more than one type is included in the filter <c>string</c> then assets that match one class will be returned. Types can either be builtin types such as <c>Texture2D</c> or user created script classes. User created classes are assets created from a ScriptableObject class in the project. If all assets are wanted use <c>Object</c> as all assets derive from Object.

        <para>When Unity loads old data from an asset or scene file, the data is dynamically upgraded in memory, but not written back to disk unless the user does something that explicitly dirties the object (like changing a value on it). This method allows you to proactively load, upgrade, and write back to disk any asset or scene files in the project, without having to manually make them dirty. Unity's usual behaviour has a number of benefits, particularly for projects with version control systems, where upgrading all the assets proactively after moving to a new Unity version would result in massive lists of changed files to be committed. However, it also has the drawback of upgrades being 'mixed in' with deliberate changes as users continue to work on a project. This method allows you to be proactive in a controlled way, deciding exactly which assets you want to upgrade and when.</para>

      <summary>
        <para>Controls whether cross-Scene references are allowed in the Editor.</para>
        <para>A cross-Scene reference occurs when you have multiple Scenes loaded in the Editor, and a component attached to a GameObject in one Scene has a reference to a GameObject in another Scene. The default value for this setting is 'true'. This means that by default, you cannot create cross-Scene references in the Unity Editor. This is prevented by default because cross-Scene references cannot be saved in Scene files. Therefore, having the Editor prevent you from creating these references avoids potential situations where your assignments cannot be saved. If you need cross-Scene references at runtime, you need to create those references at runtime - finding the GameObjects by values such as name or tag. There are, however, certain situations where you may need to create cross-Scene references in the Editor, even though these references cannot be saved - for example, if you needed to create an Editor script which should be able to operate on GameObjects from many Scenes at once. Deactivating this setting allows you to do this. Note however that deactivating this value does not mean cross-Scene references will be saved. Disabling this setting means that: 1) Dragging references from a GameObject in one Scene to another GameObject's Component field in a different Scene is allowed. 2) The Object Picker (the small target icon next to most assignable fields in the Inspector) lists choices from all open Scenes, instead of just the GameObject's own Scene. 3) Dragging GameObjects from one Scene to another Scene can result in cross-Scene references. Warnings are no longer logged when this happens.</para>

        <para>Allows you to specify whether Unity should try to use 32-bit shadow maps, where possible.</para>
        <para>Most platforms have a fixed shadow map format that you cannot adjust. These vary in format, and can be 16-bit, 24-bit, or 32-bit, and can also be either float or integer based. However, when you are targeting PS4 or platforms using DX11 or DX12, you can choose whether Unity should use a 16-bit or 32-bit float shadow map. 32-bit shadow maps give higher quality shadows than 16-bit, but they will use increased memory and bandwidth on the GPU. In addition, 32-bit shadow maps can only be used if the [depth buffer] is also set to 32-bit.</para>
