        <para>Unity Analytics provides insight into your game users e.g. DAU, MAU.</para>
        <para>Note: The documentation that follows is for usage of Unity Analytics with Unity 5.1 and above. To integrate Unity Analytics with earlier versions of Unity, refer to the documentation at https://analytics.cloud.unity3d.com/docs Specifically, out-of-the-box features include access to user engagement and retention data through Metric Monitor and Data Explorer. Segmentation of players across various user dimensions and characteristics is automatically applied, with more than 20 standard segments available without any additional instrumentation. For more detail around features, refer to the Unity Analytics homepage at http://unity3d.com/unity/analytics.</para>

        <para>To disable the sending of device stats at runtime, you must set this value to false and ensure the Analytics <c>and</c> PerformanceReporting services are also disabled. Setting this value to false has no effect while either the Analytics or PerformanceReporting services are still enabled.</para>

        <para>Controls whether the Analytics service is enabled at runtime.</para>
        <para>Setting this property to false at runtime disables the Analytics service. You can set this property to true to re-enable Analytics service, but only if Analytics was enabled when the project was built. If Analytics was not enabled when the project was built, you cannot use this setting to enable it at runtime.</para>

        <para>Setting this property to true causes the Analytics service to further anonymize data by not sending SystemInfo.deviceUniqueIdentifier for game users. By default <c>limitUserTracking</c> is false.</para>

        <para>Custom Events (optional).</para>
        <para>Unity Analytics allows you to track specific events within your game. By configuring a series of Custom Events within your game, you can create your own Funnel Analysis to observe your players' game behavior. Good places to put custom events include: milestones, new levels, scene transitions, etc. In addition to tracking custom events, Unity Analytics also allows you to pass in custom dimensions (dictionary) relating to the event. These custom dimensions are primarily useful to know additional specifications about the user at the time the custom event was reached.</para>

        <para>Attempts to flush immediately all queued analytics events to the network and filesystem cache if possible (optional).</para>
        <para>If the network is unavailable, events will stay queued for later attempts. This is convenient for testing to check if events are being sent, but should be used rarely in normal operation. Events do get flushed out more efficiently in normal operation on a low-priority worker thread.</para>
